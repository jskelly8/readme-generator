  ## Description
  Challenge 9 -- README Generator 
  
  This project was built so that a developer can easily generate a high-quality README by answering prompts in Node JS with Inquirer instead of writing out one by hand. You will answer prompted questions in order to fill out sections including Title, Description, Installation, Usage, Credits, How to contribute, Tests, and Contact for questions. There is also a prompt where you can select an included license from the top 4 most popular licenses being MIT, Apache, BSD, and Unlicensed that will add a badge and a link to the license for more info. A table of contents is already built in for easy navigation of the README. Throughout building this project, I learned how to navigate Node JS & Inquirer and interact with the system to prompt it to insert the previously written code along with the user input to make a new file, import and export data between files, and how to properly install and list dependencies for the code to function properly.

  ## Table of Contents
  - [Installation](#installation)

  ## Installation

  ## Tests
  You can freely test this application by first having the dependencies installed, open your terminal, type 'node index' and hit enter, then simply answer the questions as they appear. Once all questions are done, a README file will generate that you can preview & keep, or just delete if you were only testing or want to start over.
